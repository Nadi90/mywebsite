I work with open source data analysis languages (R) at oaiti.org to create insightful data analyses and applications. My speciality is in building automated and reproducible analytics solutions, interactive web applications and reports using R.

Recently I have been involved in projects showcasing impact, for nonprofits and resource constrained organizations.
