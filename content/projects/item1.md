These are the materials for an R Workshop I held in collaboration with Open Data Delaware. 
It was in the form of a 2.5 hour workshop for R beginner/early users.
We used my RStudio Cloud workspace for those who didn't want to install R but wanted to follow along and run the code themselves.

- **Prerequisites:** Bring a laptop and your curiosity!
- [**Slides:**](https://nadiantony.netlify.com/slides/presentation.html) Refer to these slides for content and code. 
- [**Project Workspace:**](https://rstudio.cloud/project/355872) Use this workspace if you would like to follow along without installing R on your laptop.
- **Venue:** Graham Hall
