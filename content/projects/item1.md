These are the materials for an R Workshop I conducted in collaboration with Open Data Delaware. 
It was in the form of a 2 hour workshop for R beginner/early users, where we went through basic data manipulation and visualization of census data. We used my RStudio Cloud workspace for those who didn't want to install R but wanted to follow along and run the code themselves.

- **Prerequisites:** Bring a laptop and your curiosity!
- **Slides**: Refer to [these slides](https://nadiantony.netlify.com/slides/presentation.html) for content and code. 
- **Project Workspace**: Use [this workspace](https://rstudio.cloud/project/355872) if you want to follow along without installing R on your laptop. You will need to create an RStudio Cloud login.
- **Venue:** Graham Hall
